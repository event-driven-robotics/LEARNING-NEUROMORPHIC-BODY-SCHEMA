# M3 - Laser On

# Description
Wait for moves to complete, then set the spindle speed (clockwise) or laser power.

# Notes
  - 'S is interpeted as the configured value range: PWM (default), Percentage, or RPM. (See `CUTTER_POWER_UNIT`)'
  - "[`M3`](/docs/gcode/M003.html) and [`M4`](/docs/gcode/M004.html) aren't needed with `LASER_POWER_INLINE` and `LASER_MOVE_POWER` enabled. Power is set directly in [`G1`](/docs/gcode/G000-G001.html)â€¦[`G5`](/docs/gcode/G005.html)"

# Usage
`M3` `[I<mode>]`
## Parameters
- `[I<mode>]` Inline mode ON / OFF.

# Examples
Set spindle rotation clockwise at 50% with `CUTTER_POWER_UNIT` set to `PERCENT`
