# LEARNING-NEUROMORPHIC-BODY-SCHEMA
CapoCaccia 2024 workgroup
# Proposal for Cappocacia 2024

Welcome to our proposal for the Cappocacia 2024 workshop! In this document, we outline our objectives, expertise, tools, and goals for the workshop.

üß† **Expertise:**

We bring a diverse range of expertise to the workshop, including spiking neural networks, computational models, machine learning, embodied cognition, robot simulation, and tactile sensing.

üõ†Ô∏è **Hardware/Software/Methods/Tools:**

We will be utilizing various hardware, software, methods, and tools during the workshop, such as SpiNNaker boards, Brian2, Mujoco simulator, MIMo environment, and iCub environment with tactile skin.

‚ùì **Scientific Questions:**

Our main focus is on addressing scientific questions related to body models from event-based sensory encodings like tactile and proprioceptive activations, closing the gap between spiking neural networks hardware and physical simulators, and creating generative processes using spiking neural networks.

üë®‚Äçüî¨ **Workgroup Objective:**

We will lead a workgroup titled "Learning a Neuromorphic Body Schema." Our objective is to understand the development and plasticity of body representations in biology, with a focus on tactile and proprioceptive activations.

üßê **Expertise We Hope to Find:**

We are seeking expertise in body schema development, event-driven encoding of touch and proprioception, learning inverse kinematics using neuromorphic approaches, neural encoding of touch and proprioception, and hardware like SpiNNaker, Loihi, and Brian.

üîß **Tools We Plan to Use:**

Our toolkit includes SpiNNaker boards, simple robots with artificial tactile skin, Brian2, Mujoco simulator, Open AI Gym, and more.
