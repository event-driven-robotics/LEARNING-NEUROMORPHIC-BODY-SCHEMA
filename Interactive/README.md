If you click on torso it as like you have put a buzzer on that part; It activates tactile receptive fields (which can be seen on middle-left)
Then, the model will try to reach that point using its trained network.
Current and Target joint angle neural coding is shown on lower-left
Current touch activation is shown on top-left, and Gain-Field neurons activation is ploted at the bottom of the figure.
